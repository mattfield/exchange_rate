# ExchangeRate

A small foreign exchange library.

## Installation

*Clone and `bundle exec rake install` to install this Gem. It does not exist on RubyGems as yet.*

## Documentation

Docs are provided in `doc/`, due to issues getting this onto RubyGems. Clone the repo then `open doc/index.html` to view.

## Usage

The current implementation is designed to work with the [90-day ECB feed](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist-90d.xml). Grab a copy of that,
and pop the location on disk into an environment variable:

`export XML_FEED_PATH=/path/to/feed.xml` or `ENV["XML_FEED_PATH"]=/path/to/feed.xml` if you want to avoid added to your global env.

The library exposes the following methods:

### `.at`
```Ruby
require 'exchange_rate'

# Fetch an exchange rate for the given date, between two currencies
ExchangeRate.at(date<String|Date>, currency_from<String>, currency_to<String>)

# e.g. 
ExchangeRate.at(Date.today, "USD", "EUR")
#=> 0.93642
```

*NB* `currency_from` and `currency_to` must be three-letter ISO codes, but can be either upper or lowercase.

### `.all_rates_at(date)`
```Ruby
# Fetch all exchange rates for a certain date
ExchangeRate.all_rates_at(date<String|Date>)

# e.g.
ExchangeRate.all_rates_at(Date.today)
#=> {"USD"=>1.0661, "JPY"=>121.91, "BGN"=>1.9558 ... }
```

### `.all_rates`
```Ruby
# Fetch all exchange rates for the entire feed. Returns { :date, :iso, :rate }
ExchangeRate.all_rates
#=> [{:date=>#<Date: 2017-01-13 ((2457767j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>, :iso=>"USD", :rate=>1.0661},
#    {:date=>#<Date: 2017-01-13 ((2457767j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>, :iso=>"JPY", :rate=>121.91},
#    {:date=>#<Date: 2017-01-13 ((2457767j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>, :iso=>"BGN", :rate=>1.9558},
#    {:date=>#<Date: 2017-01-13 ((2457767j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>, :iso=>"CZK", :rate=>27.021}
#    ...]
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. `SimpleCov` will output a coverage report to `/coverage`
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
